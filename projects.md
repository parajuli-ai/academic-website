## Technical Projects

---

### Text Summarization with LSA and T5 Transformers
**Duration**: February – April 2024  
**Technologies**: Python, Transformers (T5), LSA, TF-IDF, ROUGE

Implemented dual-approach text summarization combining extractive (LSA) and abstractive (T5) methods.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Extractive: TF-IDF vectorization → SVD decomposition → sentence ranking
- Abstractive: Fine-tuned T5 transformer for coherent summary generation
- TF-IDF threshold-based preview feature for navigation enhancement
- Comprehensive evaluation using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L metrics

**Outcome**: Demonstrated effectiveness of hybrid approach through quantitative evaluation
